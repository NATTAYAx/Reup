/**
 * Generates shared/store-vectors.json. Run it:
 *
 *   pnpm gen:store-vectors
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * check-sync.ts proves the desktop store against a real SQLite with the real
 * schema and the real triggers. That proof is worth something only on the
 * desktop. The phone will run a second store, and a second implementation of
 * anything is the point where this project has gone wrong every time — two
 * parsers, two translation systems, two category detectors.
 *
 * So rather than describing the store in prose and hoping the port matches, the
 * desktop writes down every statement it would emit and every decision it would
 * make, and the port has to reproduce them exactly. If the strings match, the
 * proof that the desktop's statements do the right thing against real SQLite
 * carries over without being repeated.
 *
 * The shapes are not invented here. They are read out of a real database built
 * from the real schema.sql, so the port is tested against the tables that exist
 * rather than against a tidy example of them.
 *
 * WHY THE SQL IS COMPARED WITH ITS WHITESPACE COLLAPSED
 *
 * A trigger body is a template literal here and a raw string there, and the two
 * will never indent the same way. Insisting on identical whitespace would mean
 * a test that fails for a reason nobody cares about, which is a test people
 * learn to ignore. What has to match is the statement.
